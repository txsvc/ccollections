# Container collections

Why Container collections? All coontainers under this repository are *base-line* conatiner, i.e. they provide a consistent starting point to build more specialized containers for all kinds of purposes.
This collection follows the idea of a Software Collections, as implemented in the [sclorg](https://github.com/sclorg) organization. The [sclorg/welcome](https://github.com/sclorg/welcome) page provides a detailled overview of the concept.
